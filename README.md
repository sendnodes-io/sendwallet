## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Building

You'll need a few tools to get started.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è SendWallet is built using x86_64 CPUs. Arm64 is not currently supported.

- NodeJS v16
- Yarn
- Python 3

From the root of the project run the following commands:

```sh
yarn install
yarn build:webext --  --config-name chrome # or firefox
```

Or just fancy building it without installing a bunch of extra stuff and you have Docker installed. (Or, you are the Firefox Extension Review Team ü¶ä.) Just run from the root of the project.

```sh
docker run --platform=linux/x86_64 -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app node:16 bash -c "cd app && yarn install && yarn build:webext"
```

Once that finishes, please find the built files in the `./apps/webext/dist` directory. Then, visit <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a> load the `./apps/webext/dist/chrome` directory as an unpacked extension.

### Prepare safari build (highly experimental)

```sh
xcrun safari-web-extension-converter --project-location ./ios \
  --app-name SendWallet  \
  --bundle-identifier com.sendnodes.sendwallet \
  --force \
  ./dist/safari
```
